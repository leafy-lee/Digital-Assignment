 Digital Image Processing Assignment

### Requirement
- **IPython**: for debug.
- **opencv-python**: for image utilizations.
- **numpy**: for image array processing.

**As required as using as least system function as possible**, some purpose which could be easily done will be re-implemented in some *not smart* way.

For example:
1. I use the Box-Muller Transformation to make random Gaussian distribution from uniform noise
2. I use self-implemented filter in some times.

To Do:
- [x] Write a blog about my assignment.(including skills and methods) in [leafy-lee.github.io](https://leafy-lee.github.io/), at [[数字图像处理大作业2——空间滤波 (leafy-lee.github.io)](https://leafy-lee.github.io/2022/12/06/DIPAssignment/)]
- [x] Implementing some functions.
